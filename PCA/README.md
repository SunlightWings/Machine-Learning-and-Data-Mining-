# PCA
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) works by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables, called principal components. 
These components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain, allowing you to retain the most important information in the data.

## How PCA Works
  Variance Reduction: PCA reduces the data's dimensionality by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace while retaining as much of the original variance as possible.
  Feature Extraction: It identifies the directions (principal components) in which the data varies the most. These components are linear combinations of the original features.
  Orthogonal Transformation: Principal components are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated. This ensures that each component captures unique information.

## Benefits of PCA
  Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the number of features while preserving important information.
  Visualization: Helps visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.
  Noise Reduction: Removes noise and focuses on the most important features.

## Applications
  Image Processing: Compression of images while retaining essential details.
  Genomics: Analyzing gene expression data with thousands of features.
  Face Recognition: Identifying key facial features for recognition.
