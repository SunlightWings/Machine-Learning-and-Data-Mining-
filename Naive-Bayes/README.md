# Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is particularly useful for classification tasks, especially when dealing with text data. The "naive" assumption in this classifier is that features are conditionally independent, which simplifies the calculations but may not always hold true in real-world scenarios.

## Usage Example:
from naive_bayes_classifier import NaiveBayesClassifier

 #Initialize the classifier
classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier()

 #Load training data (X_train: features, y_train: labels)
X_train, y_train = load_data()

 #Train the classifier
classifier.train(X_train, y_train)

 #Make predictions
X_test = load_test_data()
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)

 #Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = classifier.evaluate(X_test, y_true)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}%')

### Note:
Assumption of Feature Independence: The "naive" assumption that features are conditionally independent may not always hold true in real-world data.
Sensitive to Outliers: Naive Bayes is sensitive to outliers in the data, which can lead to skewed predictions.
