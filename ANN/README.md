Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They are used in machine learning to perform tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, and regression. An ANN consists of layers of interconnected nodes, known as neurons, organized into an input layer, one or more hidden layers,
and an output layer.

## Structure of an ANN:
    1. Input Layer: Neurons in this layer represent the features of the input data.
    2. Hidden Layers: These layers process the input data through weighted connections and apply activation functions to produce complex, non-linear mappings.
    3. Output Layer: Neurons in this layer produce the final results or predictions.

# Backpropagation:
Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used to train ANNs. It involves adjusting the weights of connections between neurons to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.
The process consists of the following steps:
    
    1. Forward Pass:
        Input data is fed through the network to produce a prediction.
        Each neuron's output is determined by applying an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs.

    2. Calculate Loss:
        The difference between the predicted output and the actual output is calculated using a loss function.

    3. Backward Pass (Backpropagation):
        The gradient of the loss with respect to the weights is computed using the chain rule of calculus.
        The weights are adjusted in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss.

    4. Update Weights:
        The weights are updated using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
        This process is repeated iteratively on batches of training data until the model converges to a satisfactory state.
        
# Training and Prediction:
    1. Training: The ANN is trained on a labeled dataset by repeatedly going through the forward and backward passes to adjust weights.
    2. Prediction: Once trained, the ANN can make predictions on new, unseen data by performing a forward pass through the learned weights.
